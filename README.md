# Pagination-Loadmore
Pagination in Tableview

---->  This repository includes an implementation of infinite scroll with a "load more" functionality for displaying a list of countries. The script loads        20 countries per page, allowing for a smooth and user-friendly browsing experience.

---------> To implement pagination in a single project, simply update the root view controller in the Main storyboard to switch between pagination screens as needed.🙌🏻🍾
